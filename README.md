# data-analytics


This repository contains the SQL quizzes along with their SQL commands for the concepts taught in the course "Data Analysis" by MODE at Udacity.

I have included the databases and the screensots of its ERD.

NOTE: The data dump file and the above commands works well with PostgreSQL (may or may not work with MySQL and others).

Now, SQL commands can be used to explore the dataset and run queries on it.
